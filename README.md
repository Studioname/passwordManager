# passwordManager
An app for managing passwords

A minimally guided exercise on creating a password manager for websites. I say minimally guided because as soon as I was set up with what to do, I went off and made it. Main 
areas of supervision were the message windows and the .join function. Other than that was pretty much me, and I think it went OK.

Edit: Updated to include a search function and saves to a json.
