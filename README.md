# passwordManager
An app for managing passwords

A minimally guided exercise on creating a password manager for websites. I say minimally guided because as soon as I was set up with what to do, I went off and made it. Main 
areas of supervision were the message windows and the .join function. Other than that was pretty much me, and I think it went OK.

Edit: Updated to include a search function and saves to a json. I have also just found out that I shouldn't use excpetions unless I can help it. The addition of the search function and saving to json was during a tutorial on error handling, so I figured that the best thing to do would be to implement the error catching instead of falling back on if/else's [which I initially wnated to do.] Still it works fine as is, just something for me to bear in mind for the future.
